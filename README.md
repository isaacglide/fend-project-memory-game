# Memory Game Project

## About the game

This is the classic Memory Game.  Users try to find all matching card pairs as quickly as possible using the fewest moves.  Players win win all eight pairs have been matched.

This was a given to me as a starter project for part of my Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree program.
I was given some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I converted the project from a static project to an interactive one and added a little HTML and CSS to enhance it.  All of the
Javascript was written by me except for the randomization function used to shuffle the cards.
